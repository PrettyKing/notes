this is a day i've been looking forward to for two and a half years every once in a while a revolutionary product comes along that changes everything and apple has been well first of all one's very fortunate if you get to work on just one of these in your career apple's been very fortunate it's been able to introduce a few of these into the world in 1984 we introduced the macintosh it didn't just change apple it changed the whole computer industry in 2001 we introduced the first ipod and it didn't just it didn't just change the way we all listen to music it changed the entire music industry well today we're introducing three revolutionary products of this class the first one is a widescreen ipod with touch controls the second is a revolutionary mobile phone and the third is a breakthrough internet communications device so three things a widescreen ipod with touch controls a revolutionary mobile phone and a breakthrough internet communications device an ipod a phone and an internet communicator an ipod a phone are you getting it these are not three separate devices this is one device and we are calling it iphone today today apple is going to reinvent the phone 
```

这是我两年半来一直期待的一天，每隔一段时间就会出现一种革命性的产品，它会改变一切，而苹果首先是一个非常幸运的人，如果你能从事其中的一个这些在你的职业生涯中Apple非常幸运，它能够在1984年向世界推出其中一些，我们推出了Macintosh，它不仅改变了Apple，它还改变了整个计算机行业，2001年，我们推出了第一款iPod，但它并没有改变。它不仅改变了我们听音乐的方式，它还改变了整个音乐行业。今天，我们将介绍三款此类革命性产品，第一款是带触摸控制的宽屏iPod，第二款是革命性的手机第三个是突破性的互联网通信设备所以三样东西带触摸控制的宽屏iPod革命性的移动电话和突破性的互联网通信设备这是一个设备，我们今天称它为iphone今天苹果将重新发明手机，

```plaintext
no actually here it is but we're gonna leave it there for now so before we get into it let me let me talk about a category of things the most advanced phones are called smart phones so they say and they typically combine a phone plus some email capability plus they say it's the internet sort of the baby internet into one device and they all have these plastic little keyboards on them uh and the problem is that they're not so smart and they're not so easy to use so if you kind of make a you know business school 101 graph with a smart access and the easy to use access phones regular cell phones are kind of right there they're not so smart and they're you know not so easy to use um but smartphones are definitely a little smarter but they actually are harder to use they're really complicated just for the basic stuff people have a hard time figuring out how to use them well we don't want to do either one of these things what we want to do is make a leapfrog product that is way smarter than any mobile device has ever been and super easy to use this is what iphone is okay so we're going to reinvent the phone now we're going to start with a revolutionary user interface is the result of years of research and development and of course it's an interplay of hardware and software now why do we need a revolutionary user interface i mean here's four smartphones right motorola q the blackberry palm treo nokia e62 the usual suspects and what's wrong with their user interfaces well the problem with them is really 
```

这里它实际上不在这里，但我们暂时将它留在那里，所以在我们开始之前让我谈谈最先进的电话被称为智能电话的一类东西，所以他们说，他们通常将电话和一些电子邮件功能结合在一起，再加上他们说这是互联网的一种婴儿互联网到一个设备中，他们都有这些塑料小键盘，呃问题是它们不是那么聪明，也不是那么容易使用，所以如果你用智能访问和易于使用的访问电话制作一个你知道的商学院101图表，普通手机就是这样就在那里，它们不是那么聪明，而且你知道它们不是那么容易使用，嗯，但智能手机肯定更智能一些，但实际上它们更难使用它们真的很复杂，只是人们很难理解的基本东西关于如何很好地使用它们我们不想做这些事情中的任何一件我们想做的是制造一种跨越式的产品，它比任何移动设备都更智能，而且超级容易使用这就是iphone可以的所以我们现在要重新发明手机我们将从革命性的用户界面开始这是多年研究和开发的结果当然它现在是硬件和软件的相互作用为什么我们需要一个革命性的用户界面i这意味着这里有四款智能手机摩托罗拉q黑莓palmtreo诺基亚e62常见的嫌疑人以及他们的用户界面有什么问题他们的问题实际上是

```plaintext
they all have these keyboards that are there whether you need them or not to be there and they all have these control buttons that are fixed in plastic and are the same for every application well every application wants a slightly different user interface a slightly optimized set of buttons just for it and what happens if you think of a great idea six months from now you can't run around and add a button to these things they're already shipped so what do you do it doesn't work because the buttons and the controls can't change they can't change for each application and they can't change down the road if you think of another great idea you want to add to this product well how do you solve this it turns out we have solved it we solved it in computers 20 years ago we solved it with a bitmap screen that could display anything we want put any user interface up and a pointing device we solved it with the mouse right we solve this problem so how are we going to take this to a mobile device well what we're going to do is get rid of all these buttons and just make a giant screen a giant screen now how are we going to communicate this we don't want to carry around a mouse right so what are we going to do oh a stylist right we're going to use a stylus no now who wants a stylus you have to get them and put them away and you lose them yuck nobody wants a stylus so let's not use a stylus we're going to use the best pointing device in the world we're going to use a pointing device that we're all born with we're born with 10 of them we're going to use our fingers we're going to touch this with our fingers and we have invented a new technology called multi-touch which is phenomenal it works like magic you don't need a stylus it's far more accurate than any touch display that's ever been shipped 
```

在底部40中就是这些东西就在这里他们都有这些键盘无论您是否需要它们，它们都有这些固定在塑料中的控制按钮，并且对于每个应用程序都是相同的每个应用程序都需要一个略有不同的用户界面一组略微优化的按钮专门用于它以及会发生什么如果你在六个月后想到一个好主意，你不能四处奔波并为这些已经发货的东西添加一个按钮，所以你怎么做它不起作用，因为按钮和控件无法改变它们不能针对每个应用程序进行更改，并且如果您想到要添加到该产品中的另一个好主意，他们将无法更改之前我们用一个可以显示任何我们想要的东西的位图屏幕来解决它，把任何用户界面和一个指点设备解决了我们用鼠标右键解决了它我们解决了这个问题所以我们如何将它带到移动设备上我们'我们要做的是去掉所有这些按钮，把一个大屏幕变成一个大屏幕，现在我们要如何传达这一点，我们不想随身携带鼠标，所以我们要做什么哦，造型师吧我们要使用手写笔现在谁想要手写笔你必须得到它们并把它们放好然后你把它们弄丢了哎呀没人想要手写笔所以我们不要使用手写笔我们将使用世界上最好的指点设备世界我们将使用我们生来就有的指点设备我们天生就有10个我们将使用我们的手指我们将用我们的手指触摸它我们发明了一项新技术被称为多点触控，非常了不起它就像魔术一样工作你不需要手写笔它比以往任何触摸屏都要准确

```plaintext
you can do multi-finger gestures on it and boy have we patented it so we've been very lucky to have brought a few revolutionary user interfaces to the market in our time first was the mouse the second was the click wheel and now we're going to bring multi-touch to the market and each of these revolutionary user interfaces has made possible a revolutionary product the mac the ipod and now the iphone so a revolutionary user interface we're going to build on top of that with software now software on mobile phones is like it's like baby software it's not so powerful and today we're going to show you a software breakthrough software that's at least five years ahead of what's on any other phone now how do we do this well we start with a strong foundation iphone runs os 10. now why why would we want to run such a sophisticated operating system on a mobile device well because it's got everything we need it's got multitasking it's got the best networking it already knows how to power manage we've been doing this on mobile computers for years it's got awesome security and the right apps it's got everything from coco and the graphics and it's got core animation built in and it's got the audio and video that os 10 is famous for it's got all the stuff we want and it's built right in to iphone and that has let us create desktop class applications and networking right not the crippled stuff that you find on most phones this is real desktop class applications now you know one of the pioneers of our industry allen k has had a lot of great quotes throughout the years and i ran across one of them recently that explains how we look at this 
```

申请了专利，所以我们很幸运在我们的时代为市场带来了一些革命性的用户界面首先是鼠标，其次是点击轮，现在我们将把多点触控推向市场，每一个这些革命性的用户界面使革命性的产品成为可能mac、ipod和现在的iphone所以革命性的用户界面我们将在其之上构建软件现在手机上的软件就像婴儿软件一样它不是那么强大今天我们将向您展示一款软件突破性软件，它比任何其他手机上的软件至少领先五年现在我们如何做到这一点我们从运行OS10的强大基础iphone开始。现在为什么我们要在移动设备上运行如此复杂的操作系统是因为它拥有我们需要的一切它具有多任务处理它具有最好的网络它已经知道如何进行电源管理我们多年来一直在移动计算机上这样做它具有出色的安全性和正确的apps它拥有coco和图形的一切，它有内置的核心动画，它有os10著名的音频和视频，它有我们想要的所有东西，它直接内置在iphone中，让我们可以创建桌面一流的应用程序和网络不是您在大多数手机上发现的残缺不全的东西这是真正的桌面级应用程序现在您知道我们行业的先驱之一allenk多年来有很多很棒的引述，我遇到了其中一个最近这解释了我们如何看待这个

```plaintext
and here's the quote people who are really serious about software should make their own hardware you know alan said this 30 years ago and this is how we feel about it and so we're bringing breakthrough software to a mobile device for the first time it's five years ahead of anything on any other phone the second thing we're doing is we're learning from the ipod syncing with itunes you know we're gonna ship our 100 millionth ipod this year and that's tens of millions of people that know how to sync these devices with their pcs or mac and sync all of their media right onto their ipod right so you just drop your ipod in and it automatically syncs you're going to do the same thing with iphone it automatically syncs to your pc or mac right through itunes and itunes is going to sync all your media onto your iphone your music your audiobooks podcasts movies tv shows music videos but it also syncs a ton of data your contacts your calendars and your photos which you can get on your ipod today your notes your your bookmarks from your web browser your email accounts your whole email setup all that stuff can be moved over to iphone completely automatically it's really nice and we do it we do it through itunes again you go to itunes and you set it up just like you'd set up an ipod or an apple tv and you set up what you want sync to your iphone and it's just like an ipod charge and sync so sync with itunes third thing i want to talk about a little is design we've designed something wonderful for your hand just wonderful this is what it looks like it's got a three and a half inch screen on it it's really big and it's the highest resolution screen we've ever shipped it's 160 pixels per inch highest we've ever shipped it's gorgeous 
```

解释了为什么我们按照我们的方式做事因为我们喜欢软件这是引述那些真正认真对待软件的人应该制造他们自己的硬件你知道艾伦在30年前说过这句话这是我们对此有何感想，因此我们首次将突破性软件带到移动设备上，它比任何其他手机上的任何东西都领先五年我们正在做的第二件事是我们正在学习iPod与iTunes同步你知道我们今年将出货第1亿个iPod，数以千万计的人知道如何将这些设备与他们的pc或mac同步，并将他们所有的媒体直接同步到他们的iPod上，所以你只需将iPod放入并它会自动同步你将与iphone做同样的事情它会自动同步到你的pc或mac直接通过itunes和itunes将把你所有的媒体同步到你的iphone你的音乐你的有声读物播客电影电视显示音乐视频但它也同步大量数据您的联系人您的日历和您今天可以在iPod上获取的照片您的笔记您网络浏览器中的书签您的电子邮件帐户您的整个电子邮件设置所有这些东西都可以完全自动地转移到iphone这真的很棒我们做到了我们再次通过iTunes做到这一点你去iTunes然后你设置它就像你设置ipod或appletv然后你设置你想要同步到你的iphone的东西就像ipod充电一样和同步所以与iTunes同步我想谈的第三件事是设计我们为您的手设计了一些很棒的东西这就是它看起来有一个三英寸半的屏幕它真的很大而且它是这是我们出货以来最高分辨率的屏幕它是我们出货以来最高的每英寸160像素它非常漂亮

takes you home from wherever you are that's it let's take a look at the side it's really thin it's thinner than any smartphone out there at 11.6 millimeters thinner than the q thinner than the blackjack thinner than all of them it's really nice and we got some controls on the side we got a little switch for ring and silent we've got a volume up and down control let's look at the back on the back the biggest thing of note is we got a two megapixel camera built right in the other side we're back on the front so let's take a look at the top now we've got a headset jack three and a half millimeter all your ipod headphones fit right in we've got a place a little tray for your sim card and we've got one switch for sleep and wake just push it to go to sleep push it to wake up let's take a look at the bottom we've got a speaker we've got a microphone and we've got our 30 pin ipod connector so that's the bottom now we've also got some stuff you can't see we've got three really advanced sensors built into this phone the first one is a proximity sensor it senses when physical objects get close so when you bring iphone up to your ear to take a phone call it turns off the display and it turns off the touch sensor instantly why do you want to do that well one to save battery but two so you don't get spurious inputs from your face into the touchscreen just automatically turns them off take it away boom it's back on so it's got a proximity sensor built in it's got an ambient light sensor as well we sense the ambient lighting conditions and adjust the brightness of the display to match the ambient lighting conditions again better user experience saves power and the third thing we've got is an accelerometer so that we can tell when you switch from portrait to landscape it's pretty cool show it to you in a minute so three advanced sensors built in so 
```

而且在前面只有一个按钮在那里我们称之为主页按钮无论您身在何处都可以带您回家从侧面看，它真的很薄，它比市面上的任何智能手机都薄，比q薄11.6毫米，比blackjack更薄，比所有智能手机都薄，这真的很不错，我们在侧面有一些控件，我们有一个小开关，用于响铃和静音我们有一个音量上下控制让我们看看背面背面最值得注意的是我们在另一侧内置了一个两百万像素的摄像头我们又回到了前面所以让我们来看看顶部现在我们有一个耳机插孔3.5毫米你所有的ipod耳机都适合我们有一个地方放你的sim卡我们有一个睡眠和唤醒开关只需将它推到去睡觉推它叫醒让我们看一下底部我们有一个扬声器我们有一个麦克风我们有30针ipod连接器所以这是底部现在我们还有一些东西你看不到我们在这款手机中内置了三个非常先进的传感器，第一个是接近传感器，当物理物体靠近时它会感应到，所以当你将iPhone放在耳边接听电话时，它会关闭显示屏并它会立即关闭触摸传感器，为什么你要这样做呢？一个是为了节省电池，但两个是为了避免从你的脸上向触摸屏输入虚假信息，只是自动关闭它们，把它拿走，它又重新打开了，所以它有一个内置的接近传感器它还有一个环境光传感器我们可以感知环境照明条件并调整显示器的亮度以再次匹配环境照明条件更好的用户体验节省电力我们得到的第三件事是加速度计所以当您从纵向切换到横向时，我们可以知道它非常酷在一分钟内向您展示它所以内置三个先进的传感器所以

a lot of these phones a lot of these smartphones have pretty pretty low battery life we've managed to get five hours of battery and that's for talk time or video or browsing five hours of battery life and 16 hours of audio playback so that's dramatically better than any of these smartphones there's a tremendous amount of high technology in iphone we've been pushing the state of the art in every facet of this design so let me just talk a little bit about it here we've got the multi-touch screen a first miniaturization more than we've ever done before a lot of custom silicon tremendous power management os 10 inside a mobile device featherweight precision enclosures three advanced sensors desktop class applications and of course the widescreen video ipod we've been innovating like crazy for the last few years on this and we filed for over 200 patents for all the inventions in iphone and we intend to protect them so a lot of high technology i think we're advancing the state of the art in every aspect of this design so iphone is like having your life in your pocket it's the ultimate digital device so what should we price it at well what do these things normally cost an ipod the most popular ipod 199 dollars for four gig nano what's a smartphone cost well they they say you get the phone and some of the internet with it although that's questionable but they cost somewhere between around 299. you can get them for 199. palm just introduced a new one at 399 yesterday so generally average about 299 with a two-year contract now these phones sort of do music but nobody uses them for music because they're not very good and so they end up buying an ipod to go with the phone we know we sell the ipod and so people spend 499 on this combination what should we charge for iphone because iphone's got a lot more than this stuff right it's got video real video it's got this beautiful gorgeous wide screen it's got multi-touch user interface

电池寿命一样我设法获得了5小时的电池续航时间，用于通话时间或视频或浏览5小时的电池续航时间和16小时的音频播放时间，因此这比任何这些智能手机都好得多我们在iPhone中采用了大量的高科技在这个设计的各个方面都在推动最先进的技术，所以让我在这里稍微谈一谈我们已经有了多点触摸屏，这是我们在大量定制硅之前所做的第一次小型化移动设备中的电源管理OS10轻量级精密外壳三个高级传感器桌面级应用程序，当然还有宽屏视频iPod我们在过去几年中一直在疯狂创新，我们为所有发明申请了200多项专利iphone，我们打算保护它们，所以很多高科技我认为我们在这个设计的各个方面都在推进最先进的技术，所以iphone就像把你的生活放在口袋里一样，它是终极数字设备，所以我们应该定价什么好吧，这些东西通常要花多少钱最流行的ipod199美元，四台gignano什么是智能手机，他们说你得到了电话和一些互联网，虽然这是有问题的，但它们的成本在299美元左右.你可以花199美元买到。palm昨天刚刚推出了一款新手机，价格为399，所以通常平均价格为299美元，合同期为两年，现在这些手机可以播放音乐，但没有人用它们播放音乐，因为它们不是很好，所以他们最终购买了一个ipod来搭配我们知道我们销售ipod的手机，所以人们在这种组合上花费499华丽的宽屏它有多点触控用户界面

```plaintext
it's got plaintext email it's got cover flow and on and on and on and this stuff would normally cost hundreds of dollars so how much more than 4.99 should we price iphone well we thought long and hard about it because iphone just does so much stuff so much better experience on a call and managing your contacts and visual voicemail random access voicemail for the first time texting and email and real browser and google maps and tremendous ipod and cover flow and video what should we price this thing at well for four gigabyte model we're going to price it at that same 4.99 no premium whatsoever 499 and we're going to have an 8 gigabyte model for just 5.99 so we're going to price it starting at 499 now when's it going to be available we're going to be shipping these in june yeah june we're announcing it today because with products like this we got to go and get fcc approval which takes a few months and we thought it'd be better if we introduced this rather than ask the fcc introduced to introduce it for us so here we are and we're going to be shipping it in june in the us we're going to europe hopefully by the fourth calendar quarter of this year and asia in 2008 so june in just a few months will be shipping in the us and when we do our partner is going to be singular we've chosen singular they are they are the best and most popular network in the country 58 million subscribers they are number one and they're going to be our exclusive partner in the u.s now it's a unique partnership though we're not just going to be selling phones and services together we're going to be doing innovation together we worked with singular on visual voicemail because it's an innovation that requires both innovation on the phone and in the network you can't do it in just one

它有wi-fi它有一个真正的浏览器它有plaintext电子邮件它有封面流等等等等这些东西通常要花费数百美元所以比4.99应该多多少我们给iphone定价很好，我们考虑了很长时间，因为iphone做了很多事情，所以在通话和管理您的联系人和可视语音邮件方面有更好的体验，第一次随机访问语音邮件，发短信和电子邮件，真正的浏览器和谷歌地图和巨大的ipod和coverflow和video我们应该为4GB型号的产品定价多少我们将同样定价4.99没有任何溢价499而我们将有一个8GB型号仅为5.99所以我们'我们现在打算从499开始定价，什么时候可以买到我们将在6月发货，是的，6月我们今天宣布它，因为对于这样的产品，我们必须去获得fcc批准，这需要一些时间几个月，我们认为如果我们介绍这个而不是让fcc介绍给我们介绍它会更好，所以我们在这里，我们将在6月在美国运送它，我们希望到欧洲今年的第四个日历季度和2008年的亚洲所以6月份将在短短几个月内在美国发货，当我们这样做时，我们的合作伙伴将是奇异的，我们选择了奇异的他们是最好和最受欢迎的网络在全国有5800万订户，他们是第一，他们将成为我们在美国的独家合作伙伴我们一起在可视语音邮件上与singular合作，因为这是一项创新，需要在电话和网络上都进行创新，你不能只在一个

uh made this little device called a tv jammer and it was this it was this little oscillator that put out frequencies that would screw up the tv and woz would have it in his pocket and we'd go into like a dorm at berkeley where he was going to school and a bunch of folks would be watching like star trek and he'd screw up the tv and somebody go up to fix it and just as they had their foot off the ground he'd turn it back on if they put their foot back on the ground he'd screw up the tv again and within five minutes he'd have somebody like this for the rest of the star trek episode okay so maybe it's working now maybe they're gonna have to click them for me so game consoles 26 million game consoles were sold in 2006 worldwide actually a little smaller than you think it's not such a big market digital cameras dwarfed it at 94 million mp3 players 135 million and pcs about 209 mobile phones just about a billion last year worldwide so what does this tell you what this tells you is that one percent market share equals 10 million units this is a giant market if you just one percent market share you're going to sell 10 million phones and this is exactly what we're going to try to do in 2008 our first full year in the market is grab one percent market share and go from there so we're going to enter a very competitive market a lot of players we think we're gonna have the best product in the world and we're gonna go for it and see if we get one percent market share 10 million units in 2008 and go from there so today we've added to the mac and the ipod we've added apple tv and now iphone

和我主要是史蒂夫呃制作了这个叫做电视干扰器的小设备就是这个小振荡器频率会搞砸电视，woz会把它放在他的口袋里，我们会像他去学校的伯克利的宿舍一样，一群人会像星际迷航一样看，他会搞砸了电视，然后有人上去修理它，就在他们的脚离开地面时，他会重新打开它，如果他们把脚放回地上，他会再次把电视搞砸，五分钟之内他就会星际迷航剧集的其余部分都喜欢这样的人好吧所以也许它现在正在工作也许他们将不得不为我点击它们所以游戏机2006年全球售出2600万台游戏机实际上比你想象的要少一点不是这样去年全球有9400万台MP3播放器、1.35亿台和209台移动电话的大市场数码相机使它相形见绌，只有大约10亿台，所以这告诉你什么这告诉你1%的市场份额等于1000万台这是巨大的市场，如果你只有百分之一的市场份额，你将销售1000万部手机，这正是我们在2008年要尝试做的，我们在市场上的第一个完整年度是抓住百分之一的市场份额，然后从那里开始所以我们将进入一个竞争非常激烈的市场，很多玩家认为我们将拥有世界上最好的产品，我们将全力以赴，看看我们能否在2008年获得1000万台的1%市场份额从那里开始，所以今天我们添加了mac和ipod，我们添加了appletv，现在又添加了iphone
