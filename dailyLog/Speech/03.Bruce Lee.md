INTERVIEWER: And you worked in the motion pictures in Hong Kong?
你在香港拍过电影？

BRUCE LEE: Yes, since I was around six years old.
没错，从 6 岁左右就开始了。

INTERVIEWER: And when did you leave Hong Kong?
什么时候离开香港的呢？

BRUCE LEE: 1959. When I was eighteen.
1959 年，当时我 18 岁。

INTERVIEWER: I see. Now look over to me, Bruce, as we talk. I understand you just had a baby boy?
我明⽩了。现在请看着我，听说你刚有了⼉⼦？

BRUCE LEE: Yeah.
是的。

INTERVIEWER: And you’ve lost a little sleep over it, have you?
你为他失眠了吗？

BRUCE LEE: Oh, three nights.
三宿没睡。

INTERVIEWER: And tell the crew what time they shoot the pictures in Hong Kong.
跟⼤家说说在香港你们都是⼏点拍电影？

BRUCE LEE: Well it’s mostly in the morning because it’s kind of noisy in Hong Kong. You know ... around three million people there and so... every time when they have a picture, it’s mostly, say,around 12 AM to 5 AM in the morning.
基本都是在凌晨。你知道香港有 300 万⼈⼝，所以会有些喧闹，每次需要拍电影基本都是在半夜 12 点⾄凌晨 5 点拍摄的。

INTERVIEWER: I see. You love that, do you? And you went to College in the United States?
我明⽩了，你很喜欢这⾏，是吧？你在美国上的⼤学？

BRUCE LEE: Yes.
是的。

INTERVIEWER: And what did you study?
什么专业？

BRUCE LEE: Ah, philosophy.
哲学。

INTERVIEWER: I see. Now you told me earlier today, that Karate and Jiujitsu are not the most powerful or the best forms of Oriental fighting. What is the most powerful or the best form?
明⽩了。你之前对我说，空⼿道和柔道不是最厉害的东⽅武术。最厉害的是什么？

BRUCE LEE: Well, it’s bad to say "the best" but, in my opinion, I think Kung Fu is pretty good.
呵呵，说“最厉害”好像不太好，不过我认为功夫挺不错。

INTERVIEWER: And would you tell us a little bit about Kung Fu?
可以介绍⼀下功夫吗？

BRUCE LEE: Well, Kung Fu is originated in China. It is the ancestor of Karate and Jiujitsu. It's more of a complete system and it's more fluid. By that, I mean it's more flowing; there's continuity in movement instead of one movement, two movement and then stop.
功夫起源于中国。空⼿道和柔道都是由它演化⽽来。它的体系更完整，动作更流畅。它是流动的，动作具有连贯性，⽽不是⼀两个动作就结束了。

INTERVIEWER: Would you look right into the camera lens and explain the principle of the glass of water as it applies to Kung Fu?
请看着镜头，以⼀杯⽔为例，解释功夫的奥秘。

BRUCE LEE: Well, Kung Fu -- the best example would be a glass of water. Why? Because water is the softest substance in the world,but yet it can penetrate the hardest rock or anything -- granite, you name it. Water also is insubstantial. By that, I mean you can not grasp or hold it, you can not punch it and hurt it. So every Kung Fu man is trying to do that. To be soft like water and flexible, and adapted himself to the opponent.
功夫可以比喻成⼀杯⽔。为什么？因为⽔是世界上最柔软的物质，但是它可以击穿坚硬的东⻄，比如花岗岩。⽔也没有固定的形态。抓不住、也捏不着，⽆法击打，也不会受伤。习武之⼈都以此为⽬标，像⽔⼀样柔韧灵活，因势制敌。

INTERVIEWER: I see. What's the difference between a Kung Fu punch and a Karate punch?
我懂了。功夫和空⼿道的区别是什么？

BRUCE LEE: Well, a Karate punch is like an iron bar -- whack! A Kung Fu punch is like an iron chain with an iron ball attached to the end and it goes Wang! And it hurts inside.
空⼿道攻击就像⼀根铁棒，铛！功夫攻击则像带链⼦的铁球，铛——造成内伤。

INTERVIEWER: Ok. Now we're going to cut and in just a second we'll have you stand up and show us some Kung Fu and some movements in Kung Fu.
好的，我们暂停⼀会⼉，待会⼉请你起⾝展⽰功夫动作。

BRUCE LEE: Okay.
好的。
