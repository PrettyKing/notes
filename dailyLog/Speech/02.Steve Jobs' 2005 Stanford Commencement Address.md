# 史蒂夫乔布斯斯坦福大学毕业典礼演讲 中英文双字幕

Thank you
谢谢

I'm honored to be with you today for a commencement from one of the finest universities in the world.
我非常荣幸能够和各位参加今天的毕业典礼。这里是世界上最顶尖的大学之一。

Truth be told, I never graduated from college and this is the closest I've ever gotten the college graduation.
说实话，我不曾从大学毕业。今天是我最贴近大学毕业典礼的经验。

Today, I want to tell you three stories from my life. That's it: No big ideal, just three stories.
今天，我将和你分享我人生中的三个故事。不是什么大不了的事情，就只是三个故事罢了。

The first story is about connecting the dots.
第一个故事是关于如何把生命中的点点滴滴串联起来。

I dropped out of Reed College after the first 6 months, but then stayed around as the drop-in for another 18 months or so before I really quit.
我在里德学院读了六个月就退学了。不过在那之后，我还经常去学校旁听。过了 18 个月后，才真正离开。

So why did I drop out?
我为什么要退学呢？

It stared before I was born.
故事要从我还没出生前说起。

My biological mother was a young, unwed graduate student, and she decided it to put me up for adoption.
我的亲生母亲是一个年轻的未婚女研究生，她决定让别人领养我。

She felt very strongly that I should be adopted by college graduates,
她坚持认为领养我的人必须是大学毕业生，

so everything was all set for me to be adopted at birth by a lawyer and his wife..
所以提前安排好了一切，让我一出世就能被一位律师和他的太太领养。

Except that when I popped out they decided at the last minute that they really wanted a girl.
然而，我刚出生，他们就改了主意，说想要个女孩

So my parents, who were on a waiting list, got a call in the middle of the night asking:
我的养父母当时正在等候名单上。有一天，他们突然在半夜接到电话：

"We've gotten an unexpected baby boy; do you want him?" They said: "Of course."
“我们这儿有一个计划外的男婴，你们想要领养他吗？”他们回答道：“当然！”

My biological found out later that my mother had never graduated from college and that my father had never graduated from high school.
但是我亲生母亲随后发现，我的养母从来没有上过大学，我的养父甚至连高中文凭都没有。

She refused to sign the final adoption papers.
于是她拒绝在领养文件上签字。

She only relented a few months later when my parents promised that I would go to college. This was the start in my life.
直到几个月以后，我的养父母承诺将来一定会让我读大学，她才勉强同意。

And 17 years later I did go to the college. But I naively chose the college that was almost as expencise as Stanford,
十七年后，我的确上了大学。但是我很愚蠢地选择了一间学费几乎和你们斯坦福大学一样贵的学校。

and all of my working-class parents saving were being spent on my college tuition.
我的养父母都是蓝领，他们把所有积蓄都花在了我的学费上面。

After 6 months, I couldn't see the value in it.
过了六个月后，我发现这一切毫无意义。

I have no idea what I wanted to do with my life and no idea how college was going to help me figure it out.
我不知道我真正想要做什么，我也不知道大学教育怎样能够帮助我找到答案。

And here I was spending all the money my parents had saved their entire life.
但是，我却在这里，快要把父母一辈子的积蓄给花光。

So I decided to drop out and trust that it would all work out OK.
所以我决定退学，并告诉自己一切都会水到渠成。

It was pretty scary at the time, but looking back it was a one of the best decisions I have made.
我当时确实非常的害怕，但是现在回头看，那是我这一生中做过最棒的一个决定。

The minute I dropped out I could stop taking the required classes that didn't interest me.
从我退学后的那一刻起，我终于可以不去读那些令我提不起丝毫兴趣的课程了。

and begin dropping in on the ones that looked far more interesting.
我开始到那些让我感兴趣的课旁听。

It wasn't all romantic. I didn't have a dorm room, so I slept on the floor in friend's rooms. I returned coke bottles for the 5 垄 deposits to buy food with.
那段日子一点儿也不浪漫。我不能住在宿舍里，只好在朋友房间的地板上睡觉。我收集可乐瓶子去换押金，每个 5 美分，以此果腹。

And I would walk the 7 miles across town every Sunday night to get one good meal a week at the Hare Krishna temple
每周日的晚上，我需要步行七英里，穿过整个城镇到克利须那神庙去吃每周一次的大餐，

I loved it.
我喜欢那里的饭菜。

And much of what I stumbled into by following my curiosity and intuition turned out to be priceless later on.
但是，因为我跟着我的直觉和好奇心走，遇到了很多事物，此后都成为我非常宝贵的经验。

Let me give you one example:
让我给你们举一个例子吧：

Reed College at that time offered perhaps the best calligraphy instruction in the country.
当时里德学院开办的美术字课程也许是全美最好的。

Throughout the campus every poster, every label on every drawer, was beutifully hand-calligraphed.
大学里面的每张海报、每个抽屉的标签上面，全都是漂亮的手写美术字。

Because I had dropped out and didn't have to take the normal classes, I decided to take a calligraphy class to learn how to do this.
因为我退学了，不必去上正规的课程，我便决定去参加美术字课，，学学怎样写出漂亮的美术字。

I learned about serif and san serif typefaces, about varying the amount of space between different letter combinations,
我学到了有衬线和无衬线字体，，我学会了怎么样在不同的字母组合之中改变空白间距，

about what makes great typography great.
还有怎么样才能做出最棒的印刷式样。

It was beautiful, historical, artistically subtle in a way that science can't capture, and found it fascinating.
那种美好、历史感和艺术的精妙，是科学永远不能捕捉到的。那实在是太迷人了。

None of this had even a hope of any practical application in my life
当时看起来，这些东西在我的生命中，好像都没有什么实际应用的可能。

But ten years later when we were designing the first Macintosh computer, it all came back to me.
但是十年之后，当我们在设计第一台麦金托什电脑的时候，它却帮助了我。

And we designed it all ino the Mac. It was the first computer with beautiful typography.
我把当时我学的那些东西全都设计进了麦金托什机。那是第一台使用漂亮的印刷字体的电脑。

If I had never dropped in on that single course in college,
如果我当时没有去参加那一堂课，

the Mac would have never had multiple typefaces or proportionally spaced fonts.
麦金托什机就不会有这么多丰富的字体以及赏心悦目的字体间距。

And since Windows just copied the Mac, it's likely that no personal computer would have them.
因为微软后来抄袭了麦金托什机，所以很有可能，所有的个人电脑也都不会拥有这样的特征。

If I had never dropped out, I would have never dropped in on this calligraphy class,
如果我当时没有退学，就不会有机会去参加这个美术字课程，

and personal computers might not have the wonderful typography that they do.
个人电脑也就不会拥有现在这么完美的字型。

Of course, it was impossible to connect the dots looking forward when I was in college .
当然，当时我在大学计划未来的时候，是不可能把这些联系起来的。

But it was very, very clear looking backward 10 years later.
但是，十年后，当我再回顾时，顿时豁然开朗。

Again, you can't connect the dots looking forward; you can only connect them looking backwards.
我想再次强调的是，你在计划未来的时候，是不可能将这些片段联系起来的；你只能在回顾的时候将人生中点点滴滴串连在一起。

So you have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future.
所以你必须相信这些片段会在你未来的某一天串联起来。

You have to trust in something - your gut, destiny, life, karma, whatever.
你必须要有某种信念。相信你的直觉、人生目的、命运、因缘，任何东西。

Because beliving that the dots will connect down the road will give you the confidence to follow your heart,
因为相信这一切将来都会串联起来，会给予你信心，让你随心走你想走的路，

even when it leads you off the well-worn path, and that will make all the difference.
即使那是一条不被看好的路，却因此而有了意义。

My second story is about love and loss.
我的第二个故事是关于爱和失去。

I was lucky - I found what I love to do early in life,
我很幸运，因为我在很年轻的时候就知道自己喜欢做什么。

Woz and I started Apple in my parent's garage when I was 20.
沃兹和我在二十岁的时候就在父母的车库里面开创了苹果公司。

We worked hard, and in 10 years Apple had grown from just two of us in a garage into a $2 billion company with over 4000 employees.
我们埋头苦干的结果是，苹果公司在十年间，从两个在车库的穷光蛋发展成一家拥有 4000 多名职、价值超过二十亿的大公司。

We'd just released our fiinest creation - the Macintosh - a year earlier, and I'd just turned 30.
那时，我们刚刚发布了公司最好的产品，也就是麦金托什机。我也才刚三十岁。

And then I got fired.
但就在同一年，我却被炒了鱿鱼。

How can you get fired from a company you started?
你怎么能被你一手创办的公司炒了鱿鱼呢？

Well, as Apple grew we hired someone who I thought was very talented to run the company with me,
嗯，在苹果公司快速成长的时候，我们雇请了一位很有天分的家伙，我以为他能够和我一起携手管理好公司。

and for the first year or so things went well.
刚开始的第一年多，一切还算顺利。

But then our visions of future began to diverge and eventually we had a falling out.
但是，后来，我们对公司未来的看法发生了分歧，吵了起来。

When we did, our Board of Directors sided with him.
吵得不可开交的时候，董事会站在他那边。

And so at 30 I was out. And very publicly out.
因此，我在 30 岁那一年被炒了鱿鱼，而且这个消息被闹到好大。

What had been the focus of my entire adult life was gone, and it was devastating.
我当时人生的支柱离自己远去。那真是一场毁灭性的打击。

I really didn't know what to do for a few months.
接下来的几个月，我不知所措。

I felt that I had let the previous generation of entrepreneurs down - that I had dropped the baton as it was being passed to me.
我觉得自己辜负了上一代的企业家，我把他们交给我的接力棒弄丢了。

I met with David Packard and Bob Noyce and tried to apologize for screwing up so badly.
我和创办惠普的戴维·帕卡德和及办英特尔的鲍勃·诺伊斯见面，并试图向他们道歉因为我把事情给搞砸了。

I was a very public failure, and I even thought about running away from the Valley.
我成了众人皆知的失败者，我甚至想要远远离开硅谷。

But something slowly began to drawn on me - I still loved what I did.
但是，我后来渐渐明白，我还是非常钟爱我之前从事的工作。

The turn of events as Apple had not changed that one bit. I been rejected, but I was still in love.
苹果公司发生的这些事情丝毫没有改变这一点。我被拒绝了，但是我依旧钟爱我从事的工作。

And so I dicided to star over.
因此，我决定从头再来。

I didn't see it then, but it turned out that getting fired from Apple was the best thing that could have ever happened to me.
虽然我当时没有察觉到，但是事后证明，被苹果公司炒鱿鱼或许是我这辈子发生的最好的一件事。

The heaviness of being successful was replaced by the lightness of being a beginner again, less sure about everything.
成功所带来的包袱不见了，取而代之的是重新开始的轻松感。一切变得不确定。

It freed me to enter one of the most creative periods of my life.
这种感觉让我感到自由，我进入了我生命中最有创造力的一个阶段。

During the next five years, I started a company named NeXT, another company named Pixar,
接下来的五年，我创立了一家名为 NeXT 的公司，还有一家名为皮克斯的公司。

and fell in love with an amazing woman who would become my wife.
我也爱上了一个非常有魅力的女人，她后来成了我的妻子。

Pixar went on to create the world's first computer aminated feature film, Toy Story, and is now the most successful animation studio in the world.
皮克斯后来制作了世界上第一部用电脑制作的动画电影《玩具总动员》，并且成为当今世界上最成功的动画工作室。

In a remarkable turn of events, Apple bought NeXT and I returned to Apple.
世事难料，后来苹果公司买下了 NeXT 而我又再次回到苹果公司。

And the technology we developed at NeXT is at the heart of Apple's current renaissance.
而我们在 NeXT 开发的技术在苹果公司东山再起的过程中发挥了关键的作用。

And Laurene and I have a wonderful family together.
而我和劳伦也一起建立了一个美满的家庭。

I'm pretty sure none of this would have happed if I hadn't been fired from Apple.
我相信如果当年我没有被苹果公司给开除，这一切都不会发生。

It was awful tasting medicine, but I guess the patient needed it.
这剂良药的味道实在是太苦了，但是我想病人需要这种药。

Sometime life’s gonna hit you in the head with a brick.
有些时候，生活会拿起一块砖头向你的脑袋上猛拍一下。

Don't lose faith. I'm convinced that the only thing that kept me going was that I loved what I did.
不要失去信念。我相信唯一推动我走下去的原因是我钟爱我从事的事情。

You've got find what you love. And that is as true for work as it is for your lovers.
你必须找出你钟爱的是什么。对于工作是如此，对于你的爱人也是如此。

Your work is going to fill a large part of your life, and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is the great work.
你的工作将占据你人生的一大部分。只有从事你确信是有价值的工作，你才会获得满足感。

And the only way to do great work is to love what you do.
而让工作变得有价值的不二法门是钟爱你所从事的工作。

If you haven't found it yet, keep looking and don't settle.
如果你还没找到，继续寻找，并且不要放弃，不要妥协。

As with all matters of the heart, you'll know when you find it.
像很多必须用心去体会的事物，当你遇到它的时候，你立刻就会知道。

And like any great relationship, it just better and better as the years roll on.
还有, 和所有细水长流的关系一样,随着岁月的流逝, 它只会变得更加的芳醇。

So keep looking. Don't settle.
所以继续寻找，不要放弃，不要妥协。

My third story is about death.
我的第三个故事是关于死亡。

When I was 17, I read a qoute that went somthing like:
在我 17 岁那年，我读过一句话，意思大概是这样的：

If you live each day as if it was your last, someday you'll most certainly be right.
"如果你把每天当做是生命中最后一天来过，那么总有一天，你将会发现你是对的。”

It made an impression on me, and since then, for the past 33 years, I have looked the mirror every morning and asked myself:
他留给了我很深刻的印象。从此以后，过去的 33 年，我每天早晨照镜子的时候，就会问自己：

"If today were the last day of my life, would I want to do what I am about to do today?"
“如果今天是我生命中的最后一天，我会想做我今天将要做的是吗？”

and whenever the answer has been "No" for too many days in a row, I know I need to change somthing.
如果连续几天的答案都是“不”的话，我知道自己必须做些改变了。

Remembering I'll be dead soon is the most important tool I've ever encountered to help me make the big choices in life.
记住自己即将死去，是我在面对人生重大抉择的时候，最重要的一个提醒。

Because almost everything - all external expectations, all pride, all fear of embarrassment or failure
因为几乎所有的事物，包括所有外界的期望、所有荣耀、所有对难堪和失败的恐惧，

- these things just fall away in the face of death, leaving only what is truly important.
  这些在死亡面前都会消失，留下真正重要的东西。

Remembering that you are going to die is the best way I know to avoid the trap of thinking you have sometime to lose.
人总是担心失去。记住自己即将死去，是我认为避开这种消极想法的最好方法。

You are already naked. There is no reason not to follow your heart.
你已经赤条条无牵挂了，没有理由不跟随你的心愿去生活。

About a year ago, I was diagnosed with cancer.
大概一年前，我被诊断患有癌症。

I had a scan at 7:30 in the morning, and it clearly showed a tumor on my pancreas.
我早上 7 点半做了扫描，检查清楚地显示在我的胰腺有一个肿瘤。

I didn't even know what a pancreas was.
我当时连胰腺是什么东西都不知道。

The doctors told me this was almost certainly a type of cancer that is incurable, that I should expect to live no longer than 3 to 6 months.
医生告诉我，这可能是一种无可治愈的癌症，我只剩下 3 到 6 个月的寿命。

My doctor advised me to go home and get my affairs in order, which is doctor's code for prepare to die.
我的医生劝我回家，交代好一切。那是医生对临终病人的委婉说法。

It means to try and tell your kids everything you thought you'd have the next 10 years to tell them in jsut a few months.
那意味着和你的孩子说那些你本来以为自己还有 10 年时间来告诉他们的话。

It means to make sure everything is buttoned up so that it will be as easy as possible for your family.
那意味着把一切事物都处理好，以便在你离开后，你的家人能更轻松地应付。

It means to say your goodbyes.
那意味着你要说“再见”了。

I lived with that diagnosis all day.
那一天，诊断结果占据了我的脑海，挥之不去。

Later that evening I had a biopsy, where they stuck an endoscope down my throat, through my stomach, into my intestines,
同一天傍晚，我做了一次活切片检查。医生从我的喉咙讲一个内窥镜伸进去，通过我的胃，然后进入肠子，

put a needle into my pancreas and got a few cells from the tumor.
用一根针在我的胰腺肿瘤上取了几个细胞。

I was sedated, but my wife, who was there, told me that when they viewed the cells under a microscope the doctors started crying,
我当时是被麻醉的，但是我的妻子全程在场。她告诉我医生在显微镜下观察那些细胞时，他们开始尖叫。

because it turned out to be a very rare form of pancreatic cancer that is curable with surgery.
因为他们发现这竟然是一种非常罕见的，通过手术就能治愈的胰腺癌症细胞。

I had the surgery and thankfully, I'm fine now.
我做了那个手术，很幸运的，我现在已没事了。

This was a closest I've been to facing death, and I hope it's the closest I get for a few more decades.
那是我和死亡最近距离的接触。我希望那也是我和它接下几十年最近距离的一次。

Having live through it, I can now say this to you with a bit more certainty than when death was a useful but purely intellectual concept:
从前，我只把是死亡看成是个有意思但纯粹属于抽象的概念。度过了那次生死难关，我可以更肯定地对你们说：

No one wants to die. Even people who want to go to heaven don't want to die to get there.
没有人愿意死，即使人们想上天堂，人们也不会为了去那里而死。

And yet death is the destination we all share. No one has ever escaped it.
然而死亡却是我们共同的终点。从来没有人能够逃脱它，

And that is as it should be, because death is very likely the single best invention of life.
也理应如此。因为死亡有可能是生命最好的一个发明。

It is Life's change agent. It clears out the old to make way for the new.
它推动生命去改变。它将旧的清除以便给新的让路。

Right now the new is you, but someday not too long from now, you will gradually become the old and be cleared away.
你们现在是新人，但是不久以后，你们将会逐渐的变成旧人，然后被淘汰掉。

Sorry to be so dramatic, but it's quite true.
我知道这听起来相当戏剧化，但事实确实如此。

Your time is limited, so don't waste it living someone else's life.
你的时间有限，不要浪费时间，按照别人的想法去生活。

Don't be trapped by dogma - which is living with the results of other people's thinking.
不要被社会的教条所约束，也就是遵照他人的想法来过生活。

Don't let the noise of other's opinions drowned out your own inner voice.
不要让其他人的观点淹没你内心的声音。

And most important, have the courage to follow your heart and intuition.
更重要的是，要有勇气听从心灵和直觉的召唤。

They somehow already know what you truly want to become.
它们在冥冥中已经知道你真正想要成为的样子。

Everything else is secondary.
其他的一切都是次要的。

When I was young, there was an amazing publication called The Whole Earth Catalog, which was one of the bibles of my generation.
在我年轻的时候，有一本非常了不起的刊物叫做《地球目录全编》。它被我们那一代人奉为圣经。

It was created by a fellow named Stewart Brand not far from here in Menlo Park, and he brought it to life with his poetic touch.
一个叫斯图尔特·布兰德的家伙在离这里不远的门罗帕克市创办了这本刊物，赋予它诗意盎然的风格。

This was in the late 60's, before personal computer and desktop publishing, so it was all made with typewriters, scissors, and polaroid cameras.
那是在 60 年代末，在个人电脑和桌面排版问世之前。因此，这本刊物全部是用打字机、剪刀和拍立得相机制作的。

It was sort of like Google in paperback form, 35 years before Google came along: it was idealistic, overflowing with neat tools and great notions.
它类似于平装本的谷歌，却在谷歌出现 35 年前就已经存在。它是一本理想主义的刊物，其中有很多有用的工具和伟大的想法。

Stewart and his team put out several issues of The Whole Earth Catalog,
斯图尔特和他的团队出版了几期的《地球目录全编》。

and then when it run its course, they put out a final issue.
当这份刊物完成了它的使命后，他们推出了最后一期的刊物。

It was the mid-1970s, and I was your age.
那时是 70 年代中期，而我正是你们的年龄。

On the back cover of their final issue was a photograph of an early morning country road, the kind you might find yourself hitchhiking on if you were so adventurous.
终刊号的封底是一张清晨乡村公路的照片，就是那种有冒险精神的人搭便车旅行时常常会经过的公路。

Beneath it were the words:"Stay Hungry. Stay Foolish." It was their farewell massage as they signed off.
在照片下面写着：“保持饥饿，保持愚昧”

这就是他们终刊的告别语。

Stay Hungry. Stay Foolish. And I have alway wished that for myself.
保持饥饿，保持愚昧。我希望自己会一直抱有这种心态。

And now, as you graduate to begin anew, I wish that for you.
现在，在你们即将毕业、开始新的旅程的时候，我也希望你们能够这样。

Stay Hungry. Stay Foolish.
保持饥饿，保持愚昧

Thank you all very much
谢谢。
