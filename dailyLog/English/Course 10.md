1. 片段赏析-6

   - The interview was conducted during Bruce Lee’s screen test for "Number One Son," a television series that was never made. Instead, Lee would be cast as "Kato" in The Green Hornet television series. However, this interview provides a unique keyhole through which to view Bruce Lee’s views on his life, art and career up to this time in his life. In two years time he would forsake much of the Kung fu methodology he herein embraced, and would create the art of Jeet Kune Do and, ultimately, its application as the "way of no- way."

   - 这段面试是李小龙想要参演电视剧"Number One Son"时的试镜，此剧 后来并未进行拍摄，李小龙转而饰演了电视剧"The Green Hornet" (青蜂侠)中的 Kato 一角。然而这段采访却为我们提供了一个独特的 视角，去窥探当时李小龙对于生活、艺术和事业的看法。在此后的两 年里， 他抛弃了许多当时所怀揣的功夫方法论，创造出全新的截拳道 艺术，最终得出“以无法为有法”(using no way as way)的武学思想。
