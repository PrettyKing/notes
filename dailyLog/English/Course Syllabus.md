## How can words be heard/understood?

- Listen > Read = Speak > Write (Vocabulary task priority)
- The premise of understanding is to read correctly! (Basically)
- The essence of correct reading is to model correct voice! (instead of memorizing phonetic symbols)
- Read it correctly, it is a necessary condition for being able to use it, but it is not sufficient, and it must be used repeatedly (don’t forget)
- Use the words you have memorized as much as possible every day (sentences, scenes)
- In the process of use, someone needs to interact and correct (you can't practice by yourself)

## Formulate/Proceduralize Spoken Expressions

- Commonly used sentence patterns = universal formula (farewell to Chinese translation)
- Sentence pattern accumulation = thinking establishment (subconscious, conditioned reflex)
- Daily sentence-making exercises (targeted training, get twice the result with half the effort)
